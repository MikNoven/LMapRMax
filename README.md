# LMapRMax
A Serial Reaction Time Test based on phoneme sequences derived from a finite-state grammar.
The task consists of a learning SRTT, two subsequent generation tasks (key press and oral), and a posttest SRTT. 

# Learning SRTT
The learning SRTT consists of a familiarization stage to teach subjects the phoneme-key bindings. Throughout the task, if accuracy falls below 80 % at any point, the figure of the phoneme-key bindings comes onto the screen. The information of the visibility of phoneme-key bindings are saved. 
Preliminary learning SRTT structure: 2 sessions of 15 blocks of 5 sequences of 8 elements.

# Generation task motor
Three phonemes are given and responded to with correct key presses from the subject, then the subject presses keys and told to keep to the system from which the sequences were drawn (inclusion) or not (exclusion).
Should the phonemes be played when they're pressed or not? 

# Generation task oral
Three phonemes are played to start the subjects up and then they are told to orally complete whole sequences. 

# Post SRTT
Grammatical sequences vs random.
